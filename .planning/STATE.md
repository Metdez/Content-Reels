# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-29)

**Core value:** Drop in one video and get back several genuinely good, caption-burned clips in 9:16/1:1/16:9 — locally, no cloud, no per-token API cost.
**Current focus:** Milestone v3 — Per-aspect zoom/crop transform + focused clip editor + honest progress bars. Phases 9–12. v1.0 (P1–4) and v2.0 (P5–8) complete and verified live.

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-06-30 — Milestone v4 started

### Verified live (v3, Windows 11, real binaries + browser + ffprobe)

- P9 transform model: compute_crop gains zoom + x/y pan; back-compat (8 prior render tests unchanged); 6 new unit tests. JS mirror is pixel-accurate (9:16 zoom2 → 202×360px).
- P10 pre-run preview: per-aspect zoom/pan with live WYSIWYG output frame; copy-to-all; slack-aware slider disable; transforms persist to run_params. Browser-verified pixel-parity with the renderer.
- P11 progress: weighted master bar + per-section bars; whisper-% transcribe; render per-aspect-per-clip counts; indeterminate select; screenshotted at 4 states (transcribe 35%, select indeterminate, render 2/6=67%, complete 100%).
- P12 clip editor: /job/{id}/clip/{idx}/edit — trim (snap-to-sentence), per-aspect reframe (+copy-to-all), caption text/timing edit + toggle, audio mute/volume; non-destructive edit.json; per-aspect re-render. EnlayeParis clip 1 trimmed 21.74s→13.78s across all 3 ratios (all aac, vol 0.8), mute drops audio stream, captions auto-re-derive, edit.json round-trips.

### v3 phase map (Phases 9–12)

- P9 Per-Aspect Transform Model + Crop Math — replace scalar `x_offset` with `{zoom, x, y}` per aspect in `render.compute_crop`; back-compat shim for old `x_offset` runs; unit tests (ZOOM-01/02/03)
- P10 Pre-Run Preview Upgrade — per-aspect zoom + x/y pan controls with live CSS preview mirroring the Python crop math; transforms become run defaults (ZOOM-04/05). Depends on P9.
- P11 Progress System — real transcribe % (whisper-cli) + render per-aspect-per-clip counts; weighted master + per-section bars; clips surface as they finish; Playwright-verified (PROG-01/02/03/04). Orthogonal to P9/P10.
- P12 Focused Clip Editor — `/job/{id}/clip/{idx}/edit`: trim (snap-to-sentence), per-aspect reframe (+copy-to-all), caption text/timing + toggle, audio keep/mute/volume; non-destructive `edit.json`; per-aspect re-render (EDIT-01..06). Depends on P9 + P10.

### Verified live (v2, Windows 11, real binaries + browser)

- P5 Windows port: transcribe(whisper-cli.exe) + select(claude.CMD) + render(ffmpeg) end-to-end; 28 tests pass
- P6 crop preview: upload stages → preview crop box+slider (matches compute_crop) → Run propagates x_offset
- P7 UI: studio redesign, stage stepper, clean live log (UTF-8)
- P8 audio+captions+reframe: 18/18 outputs have aac audio; uniform captions fit 9:16/1:1/16:9; reframe re-renders left/right with audio intact
- Full EnlayeParis.mp4: 6 clips selected with strong hooks, all 3 ratios each, thumbnails in review grid

### How to run

- `bash scripts/setup.sh` (one-time), then `content-machine serve` → http://127.0.0.1:8000
- CLI: `content-machine ingest <video>` → `select <job_id>` → `render <job_id>`

### Verified live

- P1 transcription correct on known-content video + VAD on silence + caching
- P2 `claude -p` selection (subscription) returns boundary-snapped clips + caching
- P3 3 aspect ratios + visible captions + thumbnails
- P4 web upload→progress→review→reframe→download

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v3 framing model: replace the single scalar `run_params.x_offset` with a per-aspect transform `{zoom≥1, x∈[-1,1], y∈[-1,1]}`; each clip can override per aspect. Back-compat shim maps old `x_offset` → `{zoom:1, x:x_offset, y:0}` so v2 jobs/manifests keep rendering. (Phase 9)
- v3 live preview: the browser CSS-transform preview and the ffmpeg crop must share ONE crop-math definition (mirror/expose `render.compute_crop`) — divergence is the main risk, gated by a pixel-parity criterion. (Phases 10, 12)
- v3 editor scope: focused per-clip tool (trim, reframe, captions, audio) with non-destructive `edit.json` and per-aspect re-render — explicitly NOT a multi-track NLE (out of scope by decision). (Phase 12)
- v3 progress: drive the transcribe bar off real whisper-cli stderr %, render bar off deterministic `len(clips)×len(aspects)`; reuse polling-over-`job.json` (`update_stage`) before reaching for SSE. (Phase 11)
- Engine locked: whisper.cpp (transcribe) + ffmpeg (cut/crop/assemble) + Pillow PNG / hyperframes (captions). video-use is a pattern reference only, not a dependency.
- Clip selection = non-bare `claude -p` on the subscription only — no API-key fallback. Cached by transcript hash.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9: `x_offset` back-compat shim is load-bearing — live v2 jobs carry scalar `x_offset` in `render.json` run_params; `compute_crop`'s `(crop_w, crop_h, x, y)` return signature must stay stable so `crop_scale_filter`/`build_render_cmd` keep working.
- Phase 10/12: JS↔Python crop-math divergence is the recurring risk — share one definition, verify pixel parity on EnlayeParis.mp4.
- Phase 11: whisper-cli stderr progress format needs a quick parse spike before planning.
- Phase 12: per-aspect dirty-tracking ("only changed aspects re-encode") and the `edit.json` schema are the load-bearing unknowns — worth a short spike/`--research-phase`.
